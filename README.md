# Coffee Machine Simulator ☕

Welcome to the **Coffee Machine Simulator**, a delightful Python console application that brings the coffee shop experience to your terminal! ☕ Order espresso, latte, or cappuccino, manage resources, process coin payments, and check machine status with ease. This project showcases Python skills like dictionaries, loops, input validation, and modular design—perfect for a beginner's portfolio! 🚀

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: The heart of the coffee machine, handling user input, resource checks, coin processing, and drink preparation.
- **`resources.py`**: Stores the coffee machine's resources (water, milk, coffee, money).
- **`menu.py`**: Defines the menu with drink recipes and prices.

## ✨ Features
- Order drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino) with an intuitive prompt. ☕
- Check resource availability (water, milk, coffee) before brewing.
- Process coin payments (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) and provide change.
- Generate a resource report with the "report" command. 📊
- Turn off the machine with the "off" command. 🔌
- Robust input validation for a smooth user experience.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yukamenes/Coffee-Machine-Simulator.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Coffee-Machine-Simulator
   ```
4. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to order drinks, check resources, or turn off the machine.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me master:
- **Dictionaries and nested data structures** for managing resources and menu items.
- **Loops and conditionals** for smooth program flow.
- **Input validation** to handle user errors gracefully.
- **Modular code design** by separating logic into multiple files.
